# aqua-mono

aqua so it can be used from anywhere with Task or Spok or Make

aqua is so stupidly complex. the CLI is bad and the error message crazy.

https://gofish.dev works and is easy.

they explain it badly here: https://aquaproj.github.io/docs/guides/wrap-aqua-with-task-runner


```sh
task 

spok

```

Make my own releases and then reuse in other proj.
